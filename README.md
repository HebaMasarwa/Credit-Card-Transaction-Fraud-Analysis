# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques and to create an interactive dashboard. Credit card fraud has increased significantly in recent years, making it increasingly important to identify fraudulent transactions early. This project demonstrates the process of understanding, analyzing, and modeling credit card transactions to detect fraud.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze credit card transactions, extract meaningful features, and build a classification model to predict fraudulent transactions. Additionally, an interactive dashboard is created to visualize trends and insights.

## Data
